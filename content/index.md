Hi, I'm Rick. A 6 years experienced software engineer, I've worked for bigtech companies as well as startups. I love coding, currently reading [SCIP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html) and learning Rust language.

Wanna know what I went through these 6 years? and what kinda things that I learned from time to time? Check out the links below:
